<p>
  I recently purchased a white 2006 MacBook (A1181) at a very low price. I bought it 
  without knowing if it even works at all, since the seller did not have the 
  power adapter. But given the cost, it was a great deal even if it was just 
  the case with nothing inside. I could always rebuild it from the ground up.
</p>

<p>
  After ordering the power adapter: It works! It starts up and boots into 
  OSX. The person who created the user on the OSX installation was not the 
  seller. That means I had to bypass the password login, just to see what 
  hardware is actually in there, because there have been a few different 
  hardware configurations.
</p>

<p>
  I managed to do this using the first method of 
  <a class="text-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjxAgiNqkDM&t=382s" target="_blank">this</a> 
  tutorial on youtube.
</p>

<p>
  Essentially I had to boot to a shell by pressing "Command"+"S" right after 
  pressing the power button. There I entered the following commands:
  This is the hardware configuration of mine:
</p>

<br>

<div class="code-box">
    <pre><code>  # mount -uw /
  # launchctl load /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.DirectoryServices.plist
  # ls /Users
  # dscl . -passwd /Users/username password
  # reboot</code></pre>
</div>

<br>

<p>
  This is the hardware configuration of mine:
</p>

<br>

<br><br>

<p>
  What I did now was upgrading the MacBook with an SSD:
</p>

<p>
  I did this by removing the battery first, and then removing 3 screws:
</p>

<br>

<img src="ram-ssd-1.jpg" style="height: ; max-height: 90%; max-width: 95%; width:1000px">

<br><br>

<p>
  After removing these 3 screws, I was able to remove the cover of 
  the RAM and HDD:
</p>

<br>

<img src="ram-ssd-2.jpg" style="height: ; max-height: 90%; max-width: 95%; width:1000px">

<br><br>

<p>
  I pulled out the HDD by the white paper sticking on the bracket. Then I 
  screwed in the new SSD and closed the MacBook again.
</p>

<p>
  Then I had to figure out installing a supported version of OSX / MacOS on 
  the SSD. This did require some research, seems like it is not easy to 
  get your hands on a working OSX installation. After 2 days of research 
  someone linked me a (totally legit installation) working raw hard disk 
  image of their Mac OS X Snow Leopard (10.6) installation. I just had to 
  flash it with 
  <a class="text-link" href="https://etcher.balena.io/" target="_blank">Balena Etcher</a> 
  and boot the MacBook from the USB using the "Option" / "Alt" key right 
  after pressing the power button and then select the right media in the boot menu:
</p>

<br>

<br><br>

<p>
  I then was greeted by the OSX installer:
</p>

<br>

<img src="installation-02.jpg" style="height: ; max-height: 90%; max-width: 95%; width:1000px">

<br><br>

<p>
  The installer did not immediatly recognize the newly built-in SSD, but that 
  was just a little filesystem issue: I just had to go to 
  "Utilities ----> Disk Utility" and reformat, or erase, the SSD to 
  a filesystem which is supported by Mac:
</p>

<br>

<img src="installation-03.jpg" style="height: ; max-height: 90%; max-width: 95%; width:1000px">

<br><br>

<p>
  After that, the SSD was recognized just fine by the installer:
</p>

<br>

<img src="installation-04.jpg" style="height: ; max-height: 90%; max-width: 95%; width:1000px">

<br><br>

<p>
  The installer worked without any issues, until a reboot which is 
  performed by the installer automatically: It rebooted and then guided me 
  through the first time setup wizard of OSX. One issue I had, was that 
  the installer got stuck while creating the local user account. 
  That was easily solved by not establishing an internet connection 
  during the setup process.
</p>

<p>
  The installation and setup succeeded!
