<p>
  BytesOfProgress now has a Discord Bot! It can perform searches for topics
  on BOP with given keyword queries.
</p>

<p>
  Command examples: "/BOP wifi", "/bop wifi"
</p>

  Click on the button below to add it to your Discord server:

<p>
  My first intention was to make the bot search for keywords over https with 
  the python module named "requests" and then parse the HTML with 
  BeautifulSoup to learn about web-scraping. After I got it to work this way, 
  I recognized that it was way too slow: It took almost a minute to process 
  a query and search through the whole website before giving the user results. 
  Because of this I decided to rewrite it to make it search through the files 
  themselves rather than via https. This shortened the time from receiving a query 
  to sending results back to the user from almost a minute to under a second!
</p>

<p>
  For some odd reason I can't figure out how to start the bot automatically 
  after a reboot. I made a cronjob that tries to start it, but the python file 
  can't resolve the hostname "discord.com", when it's not started 
  manually. So for now, I'm going to stick with restarting the bot manually after every 
  reboot of the webserver (which also runs the discord bot).
</p>

<p>
  Update: Why did the bot not work when it was launched automatically?
</p>

<p>
  When the cronjob responsible for starting the discord bot was executed at 
  reboot, it executed the python file before the networking on the server 
  started. After I added a 5 second delay to the cronjob, it starts up 
  properly after every reboot.
