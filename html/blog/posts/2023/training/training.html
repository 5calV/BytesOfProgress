<p>In August I will start the state-recognized vocational training as an IT specialist for system  integration / Computer Science Expert for system integration, or in german: „Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration“. There I am going to learn the skills to design, implement, and  maintain computer systems. This program lasts for 3 years and combines learning in the classroom with practical experience.</p>

<p>I will be gaining much knowledge of hardware, software, and networks. I am going to be learning how to configure  servers, workstations, and network components, as well as manage  operating systems and software applications. Troubleshooting is a big aspect of the training. I am developing the ability to identify and resolve technical issues that may appear with IT systems. Additionally, I will learn about implementing security measures to protect against cyber threats.</p>

<p>Practical projects will allow me to apply my knowledge and develop practical skills under the guidance of experienced professionals. After completion of the 3 year training, I will earn the qualification of  "Fachinformatiker für Systemintegration ( IT specialist for system  integration / Computer Science Expert for System Integration)“. This certification will open up many career opportunities. For example, I could work in server administration.</p>
<p>For those who want to know more, I linked the Wikipedia article about this below. Sadly, it is only available in german, but you could translate it using one of dozens of translating software that is out there.
