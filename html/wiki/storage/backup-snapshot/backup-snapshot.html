    <h1 style="font-size:25px">What is the difference?</h1>
</span>

<p>
  A backup is a complete copy of your data, and it can also include the
  operating system if you perform a full system or disk image backup,
  but typical data backups may not include the OS. This is done for long-term
  storage and recovery in case of data loss or system failure. It takes more
  time and space because it duplicates everything to another location,
  like an external hard drive (stored off-site) or the cloud.
</p>

<p>
  A snapshot is an image of your system at a specific moment.
  It’s used for short-term recovery and testing, allowing you to quickly revert
  to a previous state. Snapshots are faster to create and take up less
  disk space because they only record changes made since the last snapshot
  and are usually stored on the same device as the original data.
</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Backup</h1>
</span>

<p>
  There are different types of backups designed for various needs and scenarios.
  These include full backups, incremental backups, and differential backups.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Full Backup</h1>
</span>

<p>
  A full backup involves copying all the data from a system to a backup storage
  medium. This includes all files, folders, applications, and optionally, the
  operating system. The advantage of a full backup is that it’s easy to restore
  because everything is contained in one backup set.
  Full backups take significant amounts of time and storage space,
  which can be a exclusion criteria.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Incremental Backup</h1>
</span>

<p>
  An incremental backup only saves the changes made since the last backup,
  whether it was a full or an incremental backup. This method is faster and
  requires less storage space compared to full backups because it only
  includes new or modified data. However, restoring from incremental
  backups can be more complex and time-consuming, as it involves using
  the last full backup plus all subsequent incremental backups
  in the correct sequence.
</p>

<p>
  How to restore incremental backups? First restore the full backup, after 
  that restore the incremental backups in the oder they were made:
</p>

<p>
  Full  ---> incr-01 ---> incr-02 ---> incr-03
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Differential Backup</h1>
</span>

<p>
  A differential backup saves all changes made since the
  last full backup. This method strikes a balance between full and incremental
  backups. It is faster to create than a full backup and simpler to restore
  than incremental backups, as it only requires the last full backup and
  the most recent differential backup. Differential backups take
  more time and space than incremental backups but less than full backups.
</p>

<p>
  How to restore differential backups? First restore the full backup, then the 
  latest differential backup:
</p>

<p>
  Full ---> latest diff
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Creating & storing backups the right way</h1>
</span>

<p>
  Backups can be stored in various locations, each with its own advantages
  and disadvantages. External hard drives are portable and easy to use but
  can be lost or damaged. Network Attached Storage (NAS) offers centralized
  storage accessible from multiple devices but can be costly and requires
  network setup. Cloud storage provides scalability and remote access
  but relies on internet connectivity and may have ongoing costs.
  Traditional magnetic tape is cost-effective for large volumes of
  data and suitable for long-term storage, though it has slower
  read/write speeds and requires tape management.
</p>

<p>
  Effective backup strategies are essential for ensuring data integrity and
  availability.
  The Grandfather-Father-Son (GFS) strategy involves rotating
  backups on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis, providing multiple recovery
  points and historical versions.
  The 3-2-1 rule recommends keeping three
  copies of your data on two different types of media, with one copy
  stored offsite. Scheduling backups during low activity periods,
  known as backup windows, helps minimize impact on system performance.
</p>

<p>
  Data corruption during backups can occur if data is being written to or
  modified while the backup is running. This happens because the backup
  process might capture data in an inconsistent state, leading to errors
  or unusable backups. For instance, if a file is being updated during the
  backup, the backup may only capture parts of the file, resulting in corruption.
  To prevent this, many backup systems use techniques like snapshots or file
  system freezing, which temporarily pause write operations to ensure a
  consistent state. Additionally, scheduling backups during periods of low
  activity and using backup software that handles open files properly can
  help minimize the risk of data corruption.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Snapshot</h1>
</span>

<p>
  A snapshot is a point-in-time image of a system or data set, capturing its
  state at a specific moment. Unlike backups, which create a complete copy of
  the data, snapshots only record the state of the data and the differences
  or changes made since the last snapshot. This makes them an efficient tool
  for quickly reverting to a previous state, testing, or short-term recovery.
</p>

<p>
  When the first snapshot is taken, it captures the state of all data at that
  moment, serving as the baseline. After this initial snapshot, subsequent
  snapshots only record changes made to the data since the previous snapshot.
  These changes can include modifications, deletions, or additions.
</p>

<p>
  Because snapshots only store changes, they are much more storage-efficient
  than full backups. They use a technique called "copy-on-write" or
  "redirect-on-write." When data changes, the system first copies the
  original data to the snapshot storage and then writes the new data
  to the original location.
</p>

<p>
  Snapshots depend on the original data, meaning if the underlying data storage
  fails, snapshots alone cannot recover the lost data because they are not
  full copies. Snapshots are not designed for long-term storage or disaster
  recovery and are best used in addition to traditional backups to ensure
  data protection. As time goes on, saving lots of changes can fill up
  storage space, so it's important to sometimes clean up old
  snapshots to keep storage use in check.
</p>

<p>
  In dynamic environments, scheduling snapshots frequently—such as hourly or
  several times a day—ensures up-to-date recovery points. Implementing a
  retention policy to manage the number of snapshots retained and regularly
  deleting old snapshots helps free up storage space and reduce complexity.
</p>

<p>
  Snapshots are widely used in various scenarios. In Hypervisors they capture
  the state of virtual machines, enabling quick rollback and testing.
  Databases use snapshots to capture consistent states for replication
  and testing without interrupting operations.
  Developers use snapshots to test new features or configurations,
  allowing them to revert to a known good state if something goes wrong.
  Snapshots are also useful for system updates and patching, as they
  provide a quick way to revert if an update causes issues.
