    <h1 style="font-size:30px">History of TOR / The Onion Router</h1>
</span>

<p>
  Developed in the mid-1990s by researchers at the
  United States Naval Research Laboratory, its original
  purpose was to safeguard American intelligence communications
  online. Mathematician Paul Syverson and computer scientists Michael G. Reed
  and David Goldschlag sought a way to create internet
  connections that wouldn’t reveal who was communicating with whom.
  The concept behind Tor is onion routing, which involves
  encrypting and relaying network traffic through multiple layers,
  making it difficult to trace.
</p>

<p>
  TOR was not only developed for intelligence purposes but also found
  significant use among U.S. soldiers. During their deployments and
  operations, soldiers needed secure and anonymous communication
  channels. Tor provided a way to protect their online activities,
  ensuring confidentiality and minimizing the risk of tracking
  by adversaries.
</p>

<p>
  In 2003, Tor was released as a publicly available project.
  Tor’s impact extends beyond intelligence circles. It has
  become essential for journalists, activists, and whistleblowers
  who need secure communication. Additionally, Tor provides
  access to the dark web, where hidden websites and services
  exist. Privacy advocates worldwide rely on Tor to navigate
  the internet with increased security and confidentiality.
</p>

<p>
  In 2006, the Tor Project, Inc. was established as a nonprofit
  organization to maintain and develop Tor. This marked a
  significant shift, emphasizing community-driven efforts
  and transparency.
</p>

<p>
  During the same period, the Tor Project began developing bridges:
  A solution to address censorship. These bridges allowed users
  to bypass government firewalls, ensuring access to the open web.
  The battle against online censorship intensified, and Tor played
  a crucial role in providing uncensored communication channels.
</p>

<p>
  In 2008, the Tor Browser was created. It is a user-friendly interface
  that made Tor accessible to everyday users. Now, anyone could download
  the Tor Browser and experience the benefits of anonymous browsing.
  Tor Browser simplified privacy and anonymity, empowering users to
  navigate the internet securely.
</p>

<p>
  The Arab Spring, which began in late 2010, showcased Tor’s impact.
  As protests erupted across the Middle East, Tor became an important
  tool for activists, journalists, and citizens. It not only protected
  their identities online but also enabled access to critical
  resources, social media platforms, and blocked websites.
  Tor bridged the gap between information and action,
  allowing people to communicate freely even in repressive regimes.
</p>

<p>
  Tor’s global impact continued to grow. Privacy advocates,
  digital rights organizations, and individuals seeking uncensored
  access recognized its value. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)
  remained a steadfast supporter, ensuring Tor’s ongoing development and advocacy.
