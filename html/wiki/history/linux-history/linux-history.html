<p>
  In 1983, Richard Stallman, a prominent computer programmer and software
  freedom activist, laid the groundwork for the Free Software
  Foundation (FSF). His motivation stemmed from a growing concern over
  the increasing restrictions of proprietary software and the
  erosion of user freedom growing in the computing landscape.
</p>

<p>
  In this time Richard Stallman also initiated the GNU Project,
  a groundbreaking endeavor aimed at developing a fully free and
  open-source Unix-like operating system. However, by the early 1990s,
  the project lacked a crucial component: the kernel, the core part
  of an operating system that interacts with hardware and
  manages system resources.
</p>

<p>
  In 1991, when Linus Torvalds used Minix, he spent a month familiarizing
  himself with the system. He also learned about many of the weak points of
  Minix, which Tanenbaum developed primarily for teaching purposes.
</p>

<p>
  Torvalds was particularly frustrated with the terminal emulation he needed
  to log into the university computer and get online. It was winter, a time
  of year that, according to Torvalds, is not suitable for leaving
  the house in Finland. So he decided to write his own hardware-level
  terminal emulator which later evolved into the Linux kernel.
</p>

<p>
  Initially running on the Intel 80386 processor (i386), Linux
  embraced the principles of openness by adopting the GNU General
  Public License (GPL).
</p>

<p>
  On July 3rd, 1991, he posted a request for a readable version of the
  POSIX specifications on the Minix newsgroup. This posting alerted
  some people to Torvald's work. Ari Lemmke, who worked as an assistant
  at Helsinki University of Technology, contacted Torvalds with an offer
  to provide him with space on the university's FTP server for public
  access for the operating system he was apparently working on.
</p>

<p>
  On August 25th, 1991, Torvalds finally announced in the comp.os.minix
  newsgroup that he was working on a free operating system. A few days later, on
  September 17th 1991, the shell for his operating system was also functional,
  and Torvalds put the kernel, which at that time only had 10,000 lines of
  source code, online with version number 0.01. Linux got its name from
  Ari Lemmke, who didn't like the name Freax planned by Torvalds and quickly
  named the FTP folder Linux, a name that Torvalds had previously only used
  internally for himself.

Hello everybody out there using minix -

I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing since april, and is starting to get ready. I'd like any feedback on things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat (same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons) among other things).

I've currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work. This implies that I'll get something practical within a few months, and I'd like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions are welcome, but I won't promise I'll implement them :-)

Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)

PS. Yes - it's free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs. It is NOT portable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as that's all I have :-(</code></pre>

  The software to use with the kernel was software developed as part of the
  GNU project licensed under the GNU General Public License, a free software
  license. The first release of the Linux kernel, Linux 0.01, included
  a binary of GNU's Bash shell.
</p>

<p>
  In the "Notes for linux release 0.01", Torvalds lists the GNU software
  that is required to run Linux:
</p>

<p>
  "Sadly, a kernel by itself gets you nowhere. To get a working system you
  need a shell, compilers, a library etc. These are separate parts and may
  be under a stricter (or even looser) copyright. Most of the tools used
  with linux are GNU software and are under the GNU copyleft.
  These tools aren't in the distribution - ask me (or GNU) for more info."
</p>

<p>
  Initially, commercial use of Linux was not permitted. Then in the fall of
  1991, Torvalds went with Lars Wirzenius, the only other Swedish-speaking
  computer science student at the University of Helsinki, to a lecture by
  Richard Stallman about the GNU project. As the popularity of Linux
  increased and more and more people switched from Minix to Linux,
  he announced in January 1992 that the project would soon be placed
  under the GPL.
</p>

<p>
  In the same month, a now famous argument about the
  concept of Torvalds' operating system took place between him and
  Andrew Tanenbaum under the title Linux is obsolete. However,
  Tanenbaum's criticism did not affect the popularity of Linux.
  The free license ensured that Linux spread more and more quickly
  and was also ported to other platforms. When Linux 1.0 was released
  on March 14th 1994, Torvalds was given access to the computer
  science department's main lecture hall by his university for the
  presentation, which was also broadcast on Finnish television.
</p>

<p>
  According to Torvalds, Linux began to gain importance in 1992 after the X
  Window System (xorg) was ported to Linux by Orest Zborowski, which allowed
  Linux to support a GUI for the first time.
</p>

<p>
  After the Linux kernel was released under the GNU General Public License
  (GPL), developers recognized the compatibility between the GNU Project's
  utilities and the Linux kernel.
</p>

<p>
  The combination of the GNU Project's software with the Linux kernel
  resulted in a complete Unix-like operating system. This combined
  system provided a viable alternative to proprietary operating systems,
  embodying the principles of software freedom and openness of both
  the GNU Project and the Linux community.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  Over the time, GNU/Linux has become a cornerstone of modern computing,
  powering servers, desktops, laptops, embedded systems, and many
  other devices. It embodies the principles of free software and
  open-source development, collaboration, innovation, 
  and user freedom within the software ecosystem.
