    <h1 style="font-size:30px">BIOS / UEFI</h1>
</span>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and UEFI 
    (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) are 
    both firmware interfaces that play a crucial 
    role in the initialization and operation of a 
    computer system, particularly during the boot 
    process.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">BIOS</h1>
</span>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    BIOS is an older firmware interface that has 
    been a standard in personal computers for 
    several decades. It is a fundamental part 
    of the motherboard firmware and is responsible 
    for initializing hardware components 
    and providing basic input/output services.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    BIOS performs essential tasks, including the 
    Power-On Self-Test (POST), which checks and 
    initializes hardware components like the CPU, 
    memory, and storage devices. It also provides 
    a basic set of services for input and output 
    operations, allowing the operating 
    system to communicate with hardware.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    BIOS is stored in a non-volatile memory chip 
    on the computer's motherboard. Traditionally, 
    this memory was a ROM (Read-Only Memory) 
    chip, but in modern systems, it may be 
    a flash memory chip that allows for updates.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    When a computer is powered on, the BIOS performs 
    the Power-On Self-Test (POST) to check the 
    system's hardware components. 
    After the POST, BIOS searches for the boot 
    loader in the Master Boot Record (MBR) of the 
    boot device (typically the hard drive).
    The boot loader is responsible for loading 
    the operating system into the computer's memory.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    BIOS provides a user interface that allows users to 
    configure basic system settings. Users can 
    access the BIOS setup utility during the boot 
    process by pressing a specific key (commonly Del, F2, or F10) 
    before the operating system loads. 
    Users can configure settings such as the system date 
    and time, boot order, and CPU settings in the BIOS.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    BIOS provides a set of interrupt routines and 
    basic input/output services that allow 
    the operating system to communicate with hardware devices. 
    These services include reading from and 
    writing to storage devices, displaying characters 
    on the screen, and handling keyboard input.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Traditional BIOS has some limitations, such 
    as the 16-bit real mode addressing, which 
    restricts the system from fully utilizing 
    modern hardware capabilities.
    BIOS also has a limited capacity to handle 
    large storage devices, as it relies on 
    the MBR partitioning scheme.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    While modern computers often use UEFI, 
    many systems still provide backward 
    compatibility with BIOS for legacy reasons.
    Some operating systems and applications 
    may still rely on BIOS-specific features 
    or may not fully support UEFI.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">UEFI</h1>
</span>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI is a modern firmware interface designed 
    to replace the traditional BIOS in computer 
    systems. It was developed to address the 
    limitations of BIOS and to provide a 
    more flexible and extensible platform 
    for system initialization.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Similar to BIOS, UEFI firmware is stored 
    in a non-volatile memory chip on the 
    computer's motherboard. This memory 
    is often a flash memory chip, allowing 
    for firmware updates.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT) 
    instead of the Master Boot Record (MBR) 
    to partition and boot from storage devices. 
    It employs a boot manager that can load EFI 
    (Extensible Firmware Interface) applications, 
    which include boot loaders for various operating systems.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI provides a more user-friendly setup interface 
    compared to the text-based BIOS setup.
    Users can configure a wide range of system settings, 
    including boot options, secure boot configurations, 
    and hardware parameters through a graphical user interface.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI offers better support for modern hardware, 
    including advanced storage controllers, 
    network interfaces, and graphics cards. 
    It supports 32-bit and 64-bit architectures, 
    allowing for greater flexibility and improved 
    compatibility with contemporary computing systems.
    
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI generally boots faster than BIOS 
    due to its optimized architecture and 
    the ability to execute EFI applications 
    directly.
    The use of GPT and the absence of 
    the 16-bit real mode limitations 
    contribute to quicker boot times.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI introduces security features like Secure Boot, 
    which ensures that only signed and authorized 
    firmware and operating system components are 
    loaded during the boot process.
    Secure Boot helps protect against the 
    execution of malicious code during startup.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI is designed to be extensible, 
    allowing for the integration of 
    additional modules and drivers.
    This extensibility enhances 
    ompatibility with new hardware 
    and enables firmware updates 
    to add features or address 
    security vulnerabilities.
</p>

<br>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    UEFI represents a more advanced and feature-rich 
    firmware interface compared to BIOS. It 
    addresses the limitations of BIOS, offers 
    improved boot times, supports modern hardware, 
    and provides a more user-friendly configuration 
    interface, making it the preferred choice 
    for contemporary computing systems.
