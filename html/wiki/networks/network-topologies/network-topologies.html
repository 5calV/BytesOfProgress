    <h1 style="font-size:30px">Network Topologies</h1>
</span>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
  Network topologies describe how the different elements like clients and 
  switches are arranged in a computer network. They outline the layout of the 
  network and explain how different nodes (such as computers, switches, 
  and routers) are connected and communicate. Knowing about different network 
  topologies is important for designing, troubleshooting, and optimizing networks. 
  Here we will talk about the main types of network topologies.
</p>

<br>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Bus Topology</h1>
</span>

<img src="bus-topology.png"/>

<br>

<p>
  The bus topology is a linear network configuration where each device (node) is 
  connected to a single central cable, called the bus or backbone. 
  This central cable serves as a shared communication medium that carries 
  data transmitted by any device on the network to all other devices.
</p>

<p>
  The main backbone cable can be coaxial, twisted pair, or fiber optic, 
  depending on the requirements and scale of the network.
  Devices such as computers, printers, and servers are connected to the bus 
  via T-connectors or drop lines. Terminators are special devices attached 
  at both ends of the bus to absorb signals and prevent them from reflecting 
  back along the cable, which could cause data collisions.
</p>

<p>
  When a device wants to send data, it places a data packet onto the bus.
  The data packet includes the destination address, ensuring that only the 
  intended recipient processes the data.
</p>

<p>
  The data travels in both directions along the bus until it reaches both 
  ends or is absorbed by the terminators. Each device on the bus checks 
  the destination address and processes the data if the address matches.
</p>

<p>
  Since all devices share the same communication medium, data collisions can 
  occur when two devices transmit simultaneously. Ethernet-based bus topologies 
  use Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to 
  manage collisions: Devices listen to the bus before sending data. 
  If the bus is busy, devices wait for a random time before attempting to transmit again.
</p>

<p>
  One of the primary benefits of bus topology is its simple installation. 
  The simple layout involves minimal cabling, making it easy to set 
  up and extend by adding more devices to the central cable. 
  This simplicity also contributes to its low cost, as it requires 
  less cabling compared to more complex topologies like star or mesh. 
  Fewer network hardware components such as hubs or switches 
  are needed. The bus topology is ideal for small networks, working well in 
  environments with a limited number of devices. It is particularly suitable 
  for temporary or small-scale network setups, where quick and easy installation 
  is a priority. 
</p>

<p>
  The bus topology also has notable disadvantages. 
  One major limitation is scalability. It is effective only for small 
  networks due to issues like for example timing problems. 
  As more devices are added, network performance degrades, increasing the 
  chance of data collisions. Another significant issue is the single 
  point of failure: the central bus cable. If this backbone fails, 
  the entire network is broken.
  Troubleshooting can also be challenging, as it is difficult to identify and 
  fix problems. Any break or problem in the bus impacts the entire network. 
  The bus topology can also experience performance bottlenecks. 
  The shared communication medium limits bandwidth, and high traffic volumes 
  lead to more data collisions, resulting in reduced data transfer speeds. 
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Star Topology</h1>
</span>

<img src="star-topology.png"/>

<br>

<p>
  The star topology is a network configuration where each device is connected 
  to a central hub or switch. This central hub serves as the focal point of 
  communication, relaying data between the connected devices. 
  In this setup, devices are connected to the central hub via individual cables, 
  which can be coaxial, twisted pair, or fiber optic, depending on the network. 
  When a device wants to send data, it transmits the data packet to the central 
  hub. The hub then forwards the data packet to the destination device. 
  Data travels from the sending device to the hub, which manages and directs 
  the data packets to the right device. This central hub effectively manages 
  data traffic, reducing collisions by controlling the data flow and 
  ensuring that data packets are routed correctly.
</p>

<p>
  One of the primary benefits of the star topology is its simple installation. 
  The simple layout involves connecting each device to a central hub, 
  making it easy to set up and extend by adding more devices. 
  The star topology is ideal for small to medium-sized networks, working 
  well in environments with a limited number of devices. It is particularly 
  suitable for temporary or small-scale network setups where quick and 
  easy installation is a priority.
</p>

<p>
  The star topology also has disadvantages. One major limitation is the 
  single point of failure: the central hub. If this hub fails, the entire 
  network is disrupted.
  Troubleshooting can be difficult, as the failure of the hub affects the 
  entire network. However, identifying and isolating problems in individual 
  cables is easier compared to other topologies like the bus. 
  Performance bottlenecks can happen if the central hub becomes 
  overloaded with data traffic, leading to reduced data transfer speeds.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Ring Topology</h1>
</span>

<img src="ring-topology.png"/>

<br>

<p>
  The ring topology is a network configuration where each device is connected 
  to exactly two other devices, forming a closed ring. 
  This setup allows data to travel in a unidirectional or bidirectional 
  circular path, ensuring that each device acts as a repeater to pass the data 
  to the next device in the ring. Devices are connected in a circular loop using 
  dedicated cables which can be coaxial, twisted pair, or fiber optic.
</p>

<p>
  When a device wants to send data, it transmits the data packet to its 
  neighbor. The packet then travels from one device to the 
  next in the ring until it reaches its destination. 
  Each device checks the destination address of the data packet and forwards 
  it along the ring until the correct device receives it. 
  This process continues seamlessly, maintaining efficient data 
  flow within the network.
</p>

<p>
  One of the primary benefits of ring topology is its ability to handle high 
  volumes of data traffic efficiently. Since each device retransmits the data, 
  signal degradation is minimal, allowing the network to cover larger distances. 
  Additionally, data packets travel in a predetermined direction, reducing 
  the chance of collisions. The ring topology also simplifies network management, 
  as each device only needs to manage connections with its two immediate neighbors.
</p>

<p>
  The ring topology has, of course, disadvantages. 
  One major limitation is the network's vulnerability to a single point of failure. 
  If any device or cable in the ring fails, the entire network can be disrupted. 
  Troubleshooting can also be difficult, as identifying problems 
  requires checking every device and connection in the ring. 
  Adding or removing devices can also be complex and may require temporarily 
  breaking the ring, which disrupts network communication.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Mesh Topology</h1>
</span>

<img src="mesh-topology.png"/>

<br>

<p>
  Mesh topology is a network configuration where each device is directly 
  connected to every other device in the network, forming a fully 
  interconnected mesh of point-to-point links. 
  This structure creates multiple paths for data transmission, 
  offering high reliability, fault tolerance, and robust performance.
</p>

<p>
  In the mesh topology, each device has a direct connection to every other 
  device, either through wired (such as Ethernet cables) or wireless 
  (like Wi-Fi connections) links. This redundancy ensures that if one link 
  or node fails, data can automatically be rerouted through alternative paths, 
  keeping the communication uninterrupted. When a device initiates data 
  transmission, it can select the most efficient path available at 
  that moment, optimizing efficiency.
</p>

<p>
  The primary advantage of mesh topology is its high reliability. 
  The multiple interconnected paths minimize the risk of network downtime 
  due to link or node failures. This fault tolerance makes mesh topology 
  suitable for critical applications where uninterrupted operation is essential.
</p>

<p>
  The mesh topology supports high scalability and performance. 
  The direct point-to-point connections eliminate data collisions that can 
  occur in shared media topologies like bus or ring. 
  This setup can handle high data transmission rates and increased network 
  traffic by simply adding more links or nodes if the load becomes too much.
</p>

<p>
  The mesh topology also introduces difficulties. The implementation requires 
  significantly more resources, as each device needs to establish and 
  maintain multiple connections. The extensive cabling and hardware required 
  can result in much higher costs compared to other topologies. 
  Additionally, the complexity of network design and management increases 
  with the number of devices and connections, requiring careful planning 
  and maintenance to ensure optimal performance.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Hybrid Topologies</h1>
</span>

<img src="star-bus-topology.png"/>

<br>

<p>
  The hybrid topology is a network configuration that combines two or more 
  different types of topologies into a single network. By integrating 
  various topologies, hybrid networks can leverage the strengths of 
  each topology while lowering their individual weaknesses, offering 
  flexibility and scalability needed for specific network requirements.
</p>

<p>
  In this example, it is a star-bus topology: Combining two star topologies in 
  a bus topology.
