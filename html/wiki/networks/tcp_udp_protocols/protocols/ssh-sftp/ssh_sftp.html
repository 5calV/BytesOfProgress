<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
  SSH ( Secure Shell ) and SFTP ( SSH File Transfer Protocol ) are mentioned 
  on the same site because they both operate on the same port, which is port 22/TCP.
</p>

<p>
  SSH is a network protocol used for secure communication between computers. 
  It ensures that data exchanged between them remains confidential and that 
  the identity of each party is verified. SSH encrypts the data during 
  transmission, making it unreadable to unauthorized users.
</p>

<p>
  One of SSH's primary uses is secure remote access. It allows users to log 
  in to remote computers or servers securely. It offers various methods of 
  authentication, such as passwords, public key authentication, and two-factor 
  authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system.
</p>

<p>
  SSH can also create secure tunnels, allowing network connections like web 
  traffic or database access to pass through a secure channel. This is useful 
  for accessing resources on remote networks while keeping data safe from 
  eavesdropping.
</p>

<p>
  SFTP is an extension of SSH used for secure file transfers between computers. 
  It combines the file transfer capabilities of traditional FTP with the 
  security features of SSH. SFTP encrypts both the data being transferred 
  and the authentication process, making it a secure choice for file transfers.
</p>

<p>
  With SFTP, users can upload, download, list directory contents, create 
  directories, and set file permissions on remote systems securely. 
  It's platform-independent, meaning it can transfer files between 
  different operating systems seamlessly.
</p>

<p>
  In summary, SSH is a protocol for secure communication and remote access, 
  while SFTP is an extension of SSH used for secure file transfers. 
  Both are essential for secure data exchange and communication in the 
  digital world.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Practical Use</h1>
</span>

<p>
  You can establish an SSH connection by entering this in your Terminal:
</p>

<div class="code-box">
    <pre><code>
  $ ssh user@ip.or.domain
    </code></pre>
</div>
<br>

<p>
  To establish an SFTP connection you can use software like "FileZilla". 
  There you enter your Login-credentials (similar to the ones from SSH ). 
  After that you are able to access, organize and download the files on the 
  machine, or upload new files. Even though one can access SFTP using a Terminal, 
  it is more common to use software with GUIs ( Graphical User Interface ) 
  like FileZilla for SFTP.
