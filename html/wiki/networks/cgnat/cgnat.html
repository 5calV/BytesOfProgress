    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation</h1>
</span>

<p>
  IPv4-addresses are running out globally due to the explosion of 
  internet-connected devices. CGNAT works by translating private IP-addresses 
  of multiple customers of an Internet Service Provider (ISP) into a single 
  shared public IP-address, allowing many devices to access the internet 
  using fewer public IPv4-addresses. This way, ISPs can conserve IPv4-addresses 
  while still providing internet access to their customers.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Issues for selfhosting</h1>
</span>

<p>
  CGNAT can introduce challenges for self-hosting because it typically prevents 
  incoming connections from reaching devices behind the NAT. 
  When you self-host services like web servers, game servers, or any other 
  service that requires inbound connections, CGNAT can be problematic because 
  it doesn't allow those incoming connections to reach your self-hosted 
  services directly.
</p>

<p>
  Your ISP assigns you a private IP-address that's shared with many other 
  customers, and all traffic to and from the internet appears to originate f
  rom the same public IP-address. As a result, when external devices try 
  to connect to services you are hosting, the CGNAT device at your ISP 
  doesn't know which internal device to forward the connection to.
</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Overcoming CGNAT for selfhosting</h1>
</span>

<p>
  To overcome this limitation, you would typically need a public IPv4-address 
  that is not shared via CGNAT, or you have to use IPv6, which has a much 
  larger address space and does not suffer from the same shortage issues as IPv4. 
</p>

<p>
  There are also other ways to overcome CGNAT, for example Tunneling 
  (Cloudflare's Argo Tunnel e.g.) or using a VPS with a public IPv4.
