    <h1 style="font-size:30px">ISO/OSI Layer Model</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The ISO/OSI (International Organization for Standardization/Open Systems 
  Interconnection) layer model is a conceptual model used to understand how 
  different parts of network communication systems interact with each other. 
  It consists of seven layers, each with its own specific function. 
</p>

<p>
  This is what it looks like:

<br><br>

<p>
  Here is an overview of each layer:
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 1 / Physical Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  This is the lowest layer of the OSI model. It deals with the physical 
  connection between devices and transmission of raw data bits over a 
  physical medium such as wires, cables, or wireless signals. 
  It defines specifications like voltage levels, cable types, and data rates.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 2 / Data Link Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The data link layer provides reliable data transfer across the physical 
  layer's link. It ensures error-free transmission of data frames between 
  neighboring network nodes. This layer handles tasks such as framing, 
  error detection, and flow control. Examples of protocols operating at 
  this layer include Ethernet and Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 3 / Network Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The network layer is responsible for routing packets across multiple networks. 
  It determines the optimal path for data to travel from the source to the 
  destination based on network conditions, addressing, and routing protocols. 
  IP (Internet Protocol) is a key protocol operating at this layer.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 4 / Transport Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The transport layer ensures reliable and transparent data transfer between 
  end systems. It establishes connections, breaks data into smaller segments 
  for transmission, ensures sequencing and reordering of segments, and provides 
  error detection and recovery. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP 
  (User Datagram Protocol) operate at this layer.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 5 / Session Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The session layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions 
  between applications. It allows applications on different devices to 
  establish connections, synchronize communication, and manage data exchange. 
  It handles functions such as session establishment, maintenance, and 
  termination.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 6 / Presentation Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The presentation layer ensures that data exchanged between applications is 
  in a format that the receiving application can understand. It handles data 
  translation, encryption, compression, and formatting, making sure that data 
  sent by one application can be understood by another application regardless 
  of differences in data representation.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Layer 7 / Application Layer</h1>
</span>

<p>
  The application layer provides an interface between the network and the 
  application software. It enables communication between different applications 
  and services, allowing users to access network resources. Protocols like 
  HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), 
  and FTP (File Transfer Protocol) operate at this layer.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  Each layer of the OSI model serves as a building block, with each one 
  contributing functionalities that collectively enable the smooth 
  exchange of data between devices across a network. As information travels 
  through these layers, it undergoes a series of transformations, 
  encapsulations, and validations, ensuring that data integrity, 
  reliability, and efficiency are maintained throughout the communication 
  process. Through their coordinated efforts, the OSI layers established a 
  standardized framework that enables operability, scalability, and 
  robustness inside networked environments, enabling seamless 
  communication and interaction between devices and applications.
