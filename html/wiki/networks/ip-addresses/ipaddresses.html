    <h1 style="font-size:30px">IP-Addresses ( Internet Protocol )</h1>
</span>


    <p>
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each
device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for
communication. IP addresses play a fundamental role in networking, allowing
devices to identify and communicate with each other on the internet and within local networks.
</p>
    <p>
IP addresses are the backbone of the internet and are used to route data
packets between devices. They are an essential component of network
communication and play a crucial role in how information is transmitted
over the internet.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">2 Types of IP-Addresses</h1>
</span>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">IPv4-Address</h1>
</span>

    <p>
This is the older and most widely used IP address type. IPv4 addresses
consist of a 32-bit binary number, typically expressed in a human-readable
format like "192.168.1.1". However, due to the exhaustion of available
IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">IPv6-Address</h1>
</span>

    <p>
IPv6 is the newer IP address type designed to overcome the IPv4
address exhaustion issue. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit long and are
typically written in hexadecimal format with colons, like
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Public and Private / Local IP Addresses</h1>
</span>
    <p>
    Public IP Address: Public IP addresses are assigned to devices
    connected directly to the internet. They are globally unique and
    used to identify devices on the global internet. Websites and
    servers typically have public IP addresses.
</p>

<br>

    <p>
    Private / Local IP Address: Private IP addresses are used within
    local networks, like your home or office. They are not globally
    unique and are used for internal network communication. In a typical
    setup, a network of local IP-Addresses share one public IP-Address.
    This works because of <a class="text-link" href="/wiki/networks/NAT/NAT.html">NAT (Network Address Translation)</a>.
    For local IPv4 addresses, the specially reserved address ranges according
    to the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) RFC (Request for Comments)
    documents are usually used. These address ranges are intended for private
    use and are not intended to be routed on the public Internet.
    The most common ranges for local IPv4 addresses are:
</p>

<p>
  From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
</p>

<p>
  From 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
</p>

<p>
  From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Dynamic and Static IP Addresses</h1>
</span>

    <p>
    Dynamic IP Address: Dynamic IPs are assigned to devices by a DHCP
    (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. They may change
    periodically, especially for devices on residential internet connections.
</p>
    <p>
    Static IP Address: Static IPs are manually configured and do not change.
    They are often used for servers, routers, and network infrastructure devices
    that need to maintain a consistent address.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Network Classes</h1>
</span>

<p>
IPv4 addresses were historically divided into five classes
(A, B, C, D, and E) based on their first few bits, but classless
addressing is commonly used nowadays for more flexible address allocation.
