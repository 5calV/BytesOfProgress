    <h1 style="font-size:30px">IP-Addresses ( Internet Protocol )</h1>
</span>


    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each 
device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for 
communication. IP addresses play a fundamental role in networking, allowing 
devices to identify and communicate with each other on the internet and within local networks.
</p>
    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
IP addresses are the backbone of the internet and are used to route data 
packets between devices. They are an essential component of network 
communication and play a crucial role in how information is transmitted 
over the internet.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">2 Types of IP-Addresses</h1>
</span>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">IPv4-Address</h1>
</span>

    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
This is the older and most widely used IP address type. IPv4 addresses 
consist of a 32-bit binary number, typically expressed in a human-readable 
format like "192.168.1.1". However, due to the exhaustion of available 
IPv4 addresses, IPv6 was introduced.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">IPv6-Address</h1>
</span>

    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
IPv6 is the newer IP address type designed to overcome the IPv4 
address exhaustion issue. IPv6 addresses are 128-bit long and are 
typically written in hexadecimal format with colons, like 
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Public and Private / Local IP Addresses</h1>
</span>
    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Public IP Address: Public IP addresses are assigned to devices 
    connected directly to the internet. They are globally unique and 
    used to identify devices on the global internet. Websites and 
    servers typically have public IP addresses.
</p>
    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Private / Local IP Address: Private IP addresses are used within 
    local networks, like your home or office. They are not globally 
    unique and are used for internal network communication. Devices 
    in a local network can share the same private IP address, as 
    long as they are not connected directly to the internet.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Dynamic and Static IP Addresses</h1>
</span>

    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Dynamic IP Address: Dynamic IPs are assigned to devices by a DHCP 
    (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server. They may change 
    periodically, especially for devices on residential internet connections.
</p>
    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Static IP Address: Static IPs are manually configured and do not change. 
    They are often used for servers, routers, and network infrastructure devices 
    that need to maintain a consistent address.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">IPv4 Address Exhaustion</h1>
</span>

    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
Due to the rapid growth of the internet, IPv4 addresses have become tight. 
IPv6 was introduced to provide a vastly larger pool of addresses to handle 
the increasing number of devices connected to the internet.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">NAT ( Network Address Translation )</h1>
</span>

    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
NAT is a technique used to map multiple private IP addresses to a single 
public IP address. It's commonly used in home networks to allow multiple 
devices to share a single public IP.
    </p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Subnetting</h1>
</span>

    <p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
IP addresses are often divided into subnets to create smaller network 
segments within a larger network. Subnetting allows for more efficient 
address allocation and network management.
    </p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Network Classes</h1>
</span>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
IPv4 addresses were historically divided into five classes 
(A, B, C, D, and E) based on their first few bits, but classless 
addressing is now commonly used for more flexible address allocation.
