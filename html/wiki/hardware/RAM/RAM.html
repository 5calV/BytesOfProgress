<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
    Random Access Memory (RAM) is a crucial component in a computer 
    system that plays a key role in providing temporary storage for 
    data and program code that the processor actively uses. Unlike 
    long-term storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is 
    volatile, meaning it loses its stored information when the 
    power is turned off.
</p>

<p>
    This high-speed, temporary storage allows the 
    processor to quickly access and manipulate data, 
    significantly improving the system's overall performance. 
    RAM is essential for running applications and multitasking. 
</p>

<p>
    It's job is to efficiently managing the flow of data between 
    the processor and storage devices. 
    The capacity and speed of RAM can impact a computer's 
    ability to handle complex tasks and run multiple 
    programs simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
    This is what a RAM Module looks like:

<p>
    Note: Laptop RAM is different from the regular computer RAM when 
    it comes to form-factor, but on the technical site, they work similar.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Different generations</h1>
</span>

<p>
    DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and so on refer to different generations 
    of Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory 
    (DDR SDRAM), which is a type of RAM technology used in 
    computers and other electronic devices. 
    Each generation represents an advancement in memory 
    technology, offering improvements in speed, bandwidth, 
    and energy efficiency. Here's a simple overview of them, 
    as of writing this in the year 2024, the newest generation of RAM is DDR5.
</p>

<p>
    DDR (DDR1): The first generation, Double Data Rate Synchronous 
    Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR SDRAM), introduced in 
    the early 2000s. DDR RAM was a significant improvement 
    over the preceding Single Data Rate (SDR) RAM, as it 
    could transfer data on both the rising and falling 
    edges of the clock signal.
</p>

<p>
    DDR2: The second generation, DDR2 SDRAM, brought further 
    improvements in speed and efficiency. It was introduced around 
    2003 and featured higher data transfer rates and lower 
    power consumption compared to DDR.
</p>

<p>
    DDR3: DDR3 SDRAM, introduced around 2007, continued the trend 
    of increased speed and efficiency. It offered higher data 
    transfer rates and lower power consumption compared to 
    DDR2. DDR3 RAM became standard in many computers during its time.
</p>

<p>
    DDR4: DDR4 SDRAM, introduced around 2014, marked another 
    leap in performance and energy efficiency. DDR4 
    RAM modules provide higher data transfer rates, 
    increased capacity, and improved reliability 
    compared to DDR3. DDR4 has become the 
    standard in modern (2024) computers.
</p>

<p>
    DDR5: DDR5 is the latest generation as of writing this (2024). 
    Introduced around 2020, DDR5 SDRAM brings further improvements 
    in data transfer rates, power efficiency, and overall 
    performance compared to DDR4. DDR5 is expected 
    to become more prevalent as technology advances.
</p>

<p>
    Each successive generation of DDR SDRAM offers 
    advancements in speed, capacity, and energy 
    efficiency, making them suitable for different 
    computing needs and applications. When upgrading 
    or building a computer, it's crucial to ensure 
    that the motherboard supports the specific DDR 
    generation you plan to use, as they are 
    not backward compatible.
