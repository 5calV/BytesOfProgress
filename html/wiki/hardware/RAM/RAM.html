        </span>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
    Random Access Memory (RAM) is a crucial component in a computer
    system that plays a key role in providing temporary storage for
    data and program code that the processor actively uses. Unlike
    long-term storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, RAM is
    volatile, meaning it loses its stored information when the
    power is turned off.
</p>

<p>
    This high-speed, temporary storage allows the
    processor to quickly access and manipulate data,
    significantly improving the system's overall performance.
    RAM is essential for running applications and multitasking.
</p>

<p>
    It's job is to efficiently managing the flow of data between
    the processor and storage devices.
    The capacity and speed of RAM can impact a computer's
    ability to handle complex tasks and run multiple
    programs simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
    This is what a RAM Module looks like:
</p>

<p>
    Note: Laptop RAM is different from the regular computer RAM when
    it comes to form-factor, but on the technical site, they work similar.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Different generations</h1>
</span>

<p>
    DDR, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 and so on refer to different generations
    of Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory
    (DDR SDRAM), which is a type of RAM technology used in
    computers and other electronic devices.
    Each generation represents an advancement in memory
    technology, offering improvements in speed, bandwidth,
    and energy efficiency. Here's a simple overview of them,
    as of writing this in the year 2024, the newest generation of RAM is DDR5.
</p>

<p>
    DDR (DDR1): The first generation, Double Data Rate Synchronous
    Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR SDRAM), introduced in
    the early 2000s. DDR RAM was a significant improvement
    over the preceding Single Data Rate (SDR) RAM, as it
    could transfer data on both the rising and falling
    edges of the clock signal.
</p>

<p>
    DDR2: The second generation, DDR2 SDRAM, brought further
    improvements in speed and efficiency. It was introduced around
    2003 and featured higher data transfer rates and lower
    power consumption compared to DDR.
</p>

<p>
    DDR3: DDR3 SDRAM, introduced around 2007, continued the trend
    of increased speed and efficiency. It offered higher data
    transfer rates and lower power consumption compared to
    DDR2. DDR3 RAM became standard in many computers during its time.
</p>

<p>
    DDR4: DDR4 SDRAM, introduced around 2014, marked another
    leap in performance and energy efficiency. DDR4
    RAM modules provide higher data transfer rates,
    increased capacity, and improved reliability
    compared to DDR3. DDR4 has become the
    standard in modern (2024) computers.
</p>

<p>
    DDR5: DDR5 is the latest generation as of writing this (2024).
    Introduced around 2020, DDR5 SDRAM brings further improvements
    in data transfer rates, power efficiency, and overall
    performance compared to DDR4. DDR5 is expected
    to become more prevalent as technology advances.
</p>

<p>
    Each successive generation of DDR SDRAM offers
    advancements in speed, capacity, and energy
    efficiency, making them suitable for different
    computing needs and applications. When upgrading
    or building a computer, it's crucial to ensure
    that the motherboard supports the specific DDR
    generation you plan to use, as they are
    not backward compatible.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">SRAM / DRAM</h1>
</span>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory)</h1>
</span>

<p>
    DRAM is the kind of RAM, which you find in your typical PC or Workstation.
    It uses tiny capacitors to store data, but it needs to
    refresh them thousands of times per second to
    keep the information intact.
</p>

<p>
    When it comes to speed, it is a slower than SRAM
    because of the constant need for refreshing,
    but newer versions have improved speed.
</p>

<p>
    DRAM is the primary memory used as the main working
    space for your device. When you run programs or open
    files, the data is loaded into DRAM for quick access by the processor.
</p>

<p>
    Capacity-wise, DRAM provides a larger storage capacity compared to
    SRAM, making it suitable for handling the numerous tasks
    and data requirements of modern applications.
</p>

<p>
    DRAM enables your device to run multiple applications
    simultaneously, allowing you to switch between tasks seamlessly.
</p>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<br>
<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)</h1>
</span>

<p>
    Construction: SRAM uses a kind of memory cell called a flip-flop,
    which can hold onto data without needing constant attention.
</p>

<p>
    Size: Because of its design, SRAM is more complex
    and takes up more space on a chip compared to DRAM.
</p>

<p>
    SRAM doesn't need to constantly refresh its memory cells
    like DRAM does. This lack of refreshing makes SRAM
    faster but also contributes to its higher cost and complexity.
</p>

<p>
    Cost: It's more expensive to make SRAM, so it's
    typically used in smaller amounts for critical
    tasks (such as CPU Caches) rather than as
    the main memory in a device.
</p>

<p>
    Aside from CPU caches, SRAM is also used in certain
    high-performance applications, such as networking
    devices and high-speed buffer storage.
</p>

<p>
    SRAM tends to consume more power compared to other
    types of memory due to its continuous power usage,
    which may impact the overall energy efficiency of a device.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">ECC RAM</h1>
</span>

<p>
    ECC stands for Error-Correcting Code, and ECC RAM
    is a specialized type of computer memory that has
    additional error-checking functionality, including parity.
</p>

<p>
    The primary purpose of ECC RAM is to detect and correct errors
    that may occur in the stored data due to various factors such
    as cosmic radiation, electrical interference, or other sources
    of memory corruption.
</p>

<p>
    The term "parity" refers to an additional bit added to each byte
    of data stored in ECC RAM. This parity bit allows the memory
    to detect single-bit errors in the stored data. In the event
    of a detected error, ECC RAM can automatically
    correct the error, ensuring the integrity of the data.
</p>

<p>
    In ECC RAM, each byte (8 bit) of data is accompanied by an extra bit called a parity bit.
    The parity bit is calculated based on the number of set (1) bits in
    the data byte, and its purpose is to ensure that the
    total number of set bits (including the parity bit) is either even or odd.
</p>

<p>
    There are two types of parity: even parity and odd parity.
    In even parity, the parity bit is set to make the total number of set bits (including the parity bit) even.
    In odd parity, the parity bit is set to make the total number of set bits odd.
</p>

<p>
    But how does it detect an error?
</p>

<p>
    During the writing of data to memory, the parity bit
    is calculated and stored along with the data. When the
    data is read, the memory controller recalculates
    the parity based on the received data.
</p>

<p>
    If the calculated parity does not match the stored
    parity, it indicates a single-bit error in the data.
</p>

<p>
    The memory controller can determine which bit is in error by
    comparing the calculated parity with the stored parity.
    The faulty bit is then corrected, restoring the accurate data.
</p>

<br>

<p>
    Benefits of ECC:
</p>

<p>
    ECC RAM provides a higher level of data integrity by not
    only detecting but also correcting single-bit errors. This
    automatic error correction capability is particularly
    crucial in mission-critical applications where data accuracy is of great importance.

    <h1 style="font-size:20px">The famous Super Mario bit-flip incident</h1>
</span>

<p>
    In 2012, a speedrunner named Pannenkoek2012 was attempting to complete
    a mission in Super Mario 64 with certain constraints.
    During this attempt, a phenomenon occurred where a single
    bit in the game's memory, specifically in the non-ECC
    RAM of his device, flipped unexpectedly.
</p>

    <video width="540" height="400" controls muted src="supermario.mp4"></video>
</div>



<br>

<p>
    This event was attributed to a cosmic ray-induced single-bit
    flip, a rare occurrence but theoretically possible due to
    the vulnerability of electronic devices to high-energy
    particles from space. Cosmic rays can interfere with
    the normal operation of electronic components,
    leading to errors like bit flips.
</p>

<p>
    Pannenkoek2012 documented and analyzed this incident in a
    series of videos, and the community found it fascinating.
    While it wasn't an intentional manipulation or cheat, it showcased
    the vulnerability of electronic systems to external factors
    like cosmic rays. The incident became well-known in the
    speedrunning community and among fans of Super Mario 64.
</p>

<p>
    ECC RAM's error-detection and correction features could have potentially
    prevent the impact of a cosmic-ray-induced bit flip, preventing or
    minimizing glitches and errors.
