<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
    The mainboard, or motherboard, is the biggest and most important circuit board inside
    your computer. It's the home for all the important parts that make
    your computer work. Here are its main jobs:
</p>

<p style="font-size: 15px; text-align: center;"><a class="text-link" href="/wiki/specific_hardware/HP-Z400/HP-Z400.html">HP Z400 Mainboard</a></p>


<p>
    1: CPU Socket: This is where the computer's main chip, the <a class="text-link" href="/wiki/hardware/processors/processors.html">CPU</a>, goes.
    It's the spot where the computer's "brain" does all its thinking and
    figuring things out.
</p>

<p>
    2: RAM Slots: Think of <a class="text-link" href="/wiki/hardware/RAM/RAM.html">RAM</a> as the computer's short-term memory.
    It helps your computer do many things at once.
    The more <a class="text-link" href="/wiki/hardware/RAM/RAM.html">RAM</a> capacity,
    the more things your computer can remember at the same time.
</p>

<p>
    3: SATA Connectors: These are plugs for your computer's long-term memory (HDDs, SSDs, etc.), or
    physical disk drives.
</p>


<p>
    4: PCie-Slots: These are extra rooms in your computer. You can add
    special cards, like graphics cards or Storage Connector expansion cards to these slots.
</p>

<p>
    5: 24-Pin ATX Plug: This is where the Power Supply Unit is plugged in.
</p>

<p>
    6: Chipset: The chipset on a mainboard is a component
    that helps different parts of the computer, like the CPU and peripherals,
    to communicate effectively. It manages data flow, ensuring
    everything works together smoothly for your computer to function properly.
</p>

<p>
    7: BIOS battery: BIOS battery or CMOS battery, is a small, coin-shaped battery on the mainboard.
    It provides power to the CMOS memory, preserving critical system information
    such as date, time, and BIOS settings when the computer is powered off. If
    this battery weakens or fails, you may experience issues with system
    settings and need to replace it to maintain proper functionality.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">RAM support</h1>
</span>

<p>
    The mainboard's memory slots are specifically designed to support a certain type 
    of RAM (e.g., DDR3, DDR4, DDR5). The chipset on the mainboard defines the 
    maximum supported memory speed and capacity. The CPU must also support the 
    type of RAM used. Modern CPUs are built to support specific memory types and 
    speeds. For instance, some CPUs might support DDR4, but not DDR5, even if 
    the mainboard has slots for both. The memory controller is built into 
    modern CPUs, and it must match the type of RAM the mainboard is using.
</p>

<p>
    For full compatibility, the mainboard, chipset and CPU need to align with the RAM type.
</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<span style="color:#ff6600"></span>
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">RAM channels</h1>
</span>

<p>
    Dual-channel and quad-channel are memory configurations that enhance RAM performance 
    by allowing multiple modules to work in parallel. Dual-channel uses two identical 
    RAM sticks installed in matching slots, effectively x2 the data transfer rate. 
    Quad-channel, on the other hand, requires four identical RAM sticks, 
    increasing bandwidth and improving performance in memory-intensive tasks even further. 
</p>

<p>
    The CPU and mainboard work together to determine if a system can run in dual-channel 
    or quad-channel memory configurations. While the mainboard chipset provides the necessary 
    slots and support for these configurations, the CPU's memory controller controls 
    how many channels it can support. Most mainstream CPUs (like Intel Core i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen) 
    support dual-channel. High-end CPUs (like Intel Core i9 or AMD Threadripper) 
    may support quad-channel or even octa-channel memory. 
    In short: The CPU limits the number of channels, while the motherboard determines how they are physically configured.
