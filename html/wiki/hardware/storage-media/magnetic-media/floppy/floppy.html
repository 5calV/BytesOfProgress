<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
  Floppy disks were once a popular form of magnetic storage media for personal computers. They consist of a thin plastic disk coated with a magnetic material enclosed in a protective casing.

<br>

<p>
  Floppy disks had limited capacity, usually ranging from 1.44 MB to 2.88 MB, making them suitable for storing small amounts of data such as documents, images, and software programs.
</p>

<p>
  The standard size for floppy disks was 3.5 inches, although older formats, such as 5.25-inch and 8-inch disks, were also used in the past.
</p>

<p>
  Floppy disks were characterized by their slow data transfer rates and susceptibility to damage from physical handling, dust, and magnetic fields.
</p>

<p>
  While floppy disks have largely been replaced by other storage technologies, they played a significant role in the early days of personal computing and remain a nostalgic symbol for many computer enthusiasts.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Lifespan and Care</h1>
</span>

<p>
  Lifespan: Floppy disks are prone to degradation over time, and their lifespan can vary depending on storage conditions and usage. Proper care, such as storing them in a cool, dry environment away from magnetic fields and handling them gently, can help prolong their lifespan.
</p>

<p>
  Care: Handle with care to avoid bending or scratching the disk surface, keep away from magnetic sources, store in a protective sleeve or case to prevent dust accumulation and physical damage.
</p>
