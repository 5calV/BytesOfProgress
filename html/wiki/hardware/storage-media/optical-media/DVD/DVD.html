<p>
  DVDs (Digital Versatile Discs) are a type of optical storage media widely used for storing audio, video, and data. 
  Here we will take a closer look at them.
</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>
  DVDs were developed as an advancement over CDs, providing higher storage capacity and better quality for multimedia content. 
  The technology behind DVDs was standardized by the DVD Forum, ensuring compatibility and interoperability across different devices and manufacturers.
</p>

<p>
  DVDs are similar in structure to CDs but offer significantly higher storage capacity. They are made from a polycarbonate plastic substrate with multiple layers of data, coated with a reflective material and protected by a clear plastic layer.
</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Types of DVDs</h1>
</span>

<p>DVD-Video<br>
   Purpose: Designed for storing video content, typically movies or TV shows.<br>
   Format: Follows the DVD-Video standard.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 4.7 GB (single-layer) or 8.5 GB (dual-layer).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Read-only.
</p>

<p>DVD-ROM (Digital Versatile Disc Read-Only Memory)<br>
   Purpose: Used for data storage and distribution of software, games, and multimedia applications.<br>
   Format: Follows the DVD-ROM standard.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 4.7 GB (single-layer) or 8.5 GB (dual-layer).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Read-only, typically 1.32 MB/s to 10.08 MB/s (1x to 8x).
</p>

<p>DVD-R (Digital Versatile Disc Recordable)<br>
   Purpose: Writable DVDs that can be recorded once.<br>
   Technology: Uses a dye layer that can be altered by a laser to store data.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 4.7 GB (single-layer) or 8.5 GB (dual-layer).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Typically 1.32 MB/s to 10.08 MB/s (1x to 8x write speed).
</p>

<p>DVD-RW (Digital Versatile Disc Rewritable)<br>
   Purpose: Rewritable DVDs that can be erased and recorded multiple times.<br>
   Technology: Uses a phase-change alloy that can be heated by a laser to change its crystalline structure.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 4.7 GB (single-layer) or 8.5 GB (dual-layer).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Typically 1.32 MB/s to 10.08 MB/s (1x to 8x write and rewrite speed).
</p>

<p>DVD+R (Digital Versatile Disc Recordable)<br>
   Purpose: Another format of writable DVDs, similar to DVD-R but with different technical specifications.<br>
   Technology: Uses a different method of data encoding compared to DVD-R.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 4.7 GB (single-layer) or 8.5 GB (dual-layer).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Typically 1.32 MB/s to 10.08 MB/s (1x to 8x write speed).
</p>

<p>DVD+RW (Digital Versatile Disc Rewritable)<br>
   Purpose: Another format of rewritable DVDs, similar to DVD-RW but with different technical specifications.<br>
   Technology: Uses a different method of data encoding compared to DVD-RW.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 4.7 GB (single-layer) or 8.5 GB (dual-layer).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Typically 1.32 MB/s to 10.08 MB/s (1x to 8x write and rewrite speed).
</p>

<br>

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Lifespan and Care</h1>
</span>

<p>
  Lifespan: Properly stored DVDs can last for decades, but exposure to heat, humidity, and physical damage can shorten their lifespan.
</p>

<p>
  Care: Store in a cool, dry place; handle by the edges to avoid fingerprints and scratches; keep in protective cases.
</p>
