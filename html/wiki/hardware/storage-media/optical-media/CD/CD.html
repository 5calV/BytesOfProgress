<p>
  Compact Discs (CDs) are a type of optical storage media which was widely 
  used for audio, video, and data storage. 
  Here we will take a closer look at them.
</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>
  Compact Discs were developed by Philips and Sony in the late 
  1970s and early 1980s. This collaboration led to the introduction of 
  the first commercial CDs and CD players in 1982, marking a significant 
  milestone in the evolution of digital media. The technology was standardized 
  by the Red Book, which established the format for audio CDs and ensured 
  consistent quality and compatibility across devices.
</p>

<p>
  Compact Discs (CDs) are made from a 1.2 mm thick plastic base with a 
  reflective aluminum layer and a protective coating. They can hold up to 
  700 MB of data or 80 minutes of audio. Data is stored on a CD in a spiral 
  track of tiny bumps (pits) and flat areas (lands). A laser in the CD player 
  reads these pits and lands, detecting differences in reflectivity to 
  convert them into digital data.
</p>

<p>
  There are smaller versions of standard CDs and DVDs, typically with 
  a diameter of 80 mm instead of 120 mm.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Different kinds of Compact Discs</h1>
</span>

<p>Audio CDs (CD-DA)<br>
   Purpose: Specifically designed for storing digital audio.<br>
   Format: Follows the Red Book standard.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 80 minutes of audio.<br>
   R/W Speeds: Read-only, typically 150 KB/s.
</p>

<p>CD-ROM (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory)<br>
   Purpose: Used for data storage and distribution of software, games, and multimedia applications.<br>
   Format: Follows the Yellow Book standard.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 700 MB.<br>
   R/W Speeds: Read-only, typically 150 KB/s to 7,200 KB/s (1x to 48x).
</p>

<p>CD-R (Compact Disc Recordable)<br>
   Purpose: Writable CDs that can be recorded once.<br>
   Technology: Uses a dye layer that can be altered by a laser to store data.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 700 MB.<br>
   R/W Speeds: Typically 600 KB/s to 7,800 KB/s (4x to 52x write speed).
</p>

<p>CD-RW (Compact Disc Rewritable)<br>
   Purpose: Rewritable CDs that can be erased and recorded multiple times.<br>
   Technology: Uses a special alloy that changes phase when heated by a laser, allowing data to be rewritten.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 700 MB.<br>
   R/W Speeds: Typically 600 KB/s to 4,800 KB/s (4x to 32x write and rewrite speed).
</p>

<p>Enhanced CDs (CD-Extra)<br>
   Purpose: Combine audio and data tracks, allowing for multimedia content.<br>
   Format: Follows the Blue Book standard.<br>
   Capacity: Up to 700 MB (including audio and data).<br>
   R/W Speeds: Read-only for pre-recorded content; writable speeds depend on CD-R or CD-RW type used.
</p>

<br>

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Lifespan and Care</h1>
</span>


<p>
  Lifespan: Properly stored CDs can last for decades, but exposure to heat, 
  humidity, and physical damage can shorten their lifespan.
</p>

<p>
  Care: Store in a cool, dry place; handle by the edges to avoid fingerprints 
  and scratches; keep in protective cases.
</p>
