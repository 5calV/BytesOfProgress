<p>
    x86 CPUs are known for their versatility and are commonly used in personal computers. 
    They handle a wide range of tasks and can run various types of software. 
    The x86 architecture has evolved over the years, and modern x86 CPUs 
    often have multiple cores and advanced features to handle complex tasks efficiently.
</p>

<p>
    The CPU grabs instructions from the computer's memory. 
    Then, it figures out what each instruction is asking it to do. 
    Next, it does the actual work: adding numbers, moving things around, 
    or whatever the instructions might be.
</p>

<p>
    The x86 CPU has a small but high-speed memory known as a cache (SRAM). 
    Think of it like a workspace where the CPU stores regularly used 
    information or tools, making it faster to retrieve them. 
    This speeds up the CPU's performance by reducing the 
    need to constantly go back to the main memory for every small task.
</p>

<p>
    A CPU is capable of managing numerous processes simultaneously. 
    It achieves this by switching between tasks really fast, creating 
    the illusion that everything is happening simultaneously.
</p>

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Different kinds of caches</h1>
</span>

<p>
    The trade-off between speed and size is a common consideration in cache 
    design, and the hierarchy of L1, L2, and L3 caches is optimized to 
    balance these factors for efficient overall system performance.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">L1 Cache</h1>
</span>

<p>
    The L1d (Data Cache) is typically the fastest but also the 
    smallest among the different cache levels. It's designed to 
    provide extremely fast access to frequently used data 
    directly associated with a specific CPU core. Due to 
    its proximity to the core, the L1d cache can deliver 
    data at speeds that are crucial for minimizing 
    latency in program execution.

</p>

<p>
    Per-core: Each CPU core typically has its own dedicated L1 cache.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">L2 Cache</h1>
</span>

<p>
    The L2 Cache is faster than the L3 cache but slower than the L1 cache. 
    It falls in between in terms of both speed and size. Like the L1 
    cache, each CPU core usually has its own dedicated L2 cache, 
    providing a larger storage capacity compared to L1. This 
    cache serves as a middle ground, offering faster access 
    than the L3 cache while still maintaining a reasonable size.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">L3 Cache</h1>
</span>

<p>
    The L3 Cache is larger than both L1 and L2 caches but is slower in 
    terms of access speed. Unlike the per-core L1 and L2 caches, the 
    L3 cache is shared among all CPU cores. It acts as a common pool 
    of cached data for communication between different cores. 
    While not as fast as the L1 and L2 caches, the L3 cache 
    provides a larger storage capacity for frequently 
    accessed data that can be shared among multiple 
    cores, contributing to overall system efficiency.
