<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    RAID, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks (previously called 
    "redundant array of inexpensive disks"), is a 
    storage technology that combines multiple physical disk 
    drives into a single logical unit for the purpose of data 
    redundancy, performance improvement, or both. There are several 
    RAID levels, each with its own configuration and benefits.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    In a RAID array, data is distributed or replicated across 
    the member drives according to the chosen RAID level. The 
    two primary categories of RAID configurations are 
    mirroring and striping.

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    In hardware RAID, a special controller 
    takes care of the RAID tasks, and it's often 
    part of the storage system. This controller has 
    its own processing power, which can make it faster, 
    but it can also be more expensive. This is what 
    a hardware RAID controller looks like:

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Setting up hardware RAID is done through a dedicated interface 
    or tool from the RAID controller, similar to accessing the BIOS. 
    When it comes to moving RAID configurations to a different system, 
    hardware RAID can be trickier because it depends on a specific 
    RAID controller.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Software RAID</h1>
</span>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Software RAID is generally more flexible and can be 
    moved between systems with compatible software support. 
    Software RAID is managed directly through the operating system.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Unlike hardware RAID, which has its dedicated processor, 
    software RAID uses the computer's CPU and RAM for RAID calculations. While this 
    may cause a slight overhead, modern CPUs are 
    mostly powerful enough to handle these tasks efficiently.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Software RAID configurations can be easily adjusted and managed 
    through the operating system's tools. This flexibility allows 
    users to create, modify, or delete RAID arrays without the 
    need for specialized hardware or additional components.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    One of the primary advantages of software RAID is its cost-effectiveness. 
    Since it relies on the existing resources of the host system, there is 
    no need for a separate RAID controller, making it 
    a more budget-friendly solution.
