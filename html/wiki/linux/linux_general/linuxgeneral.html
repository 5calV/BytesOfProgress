    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Many Distributions or "Distros"</h1>
</span>


    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Debian-Based Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
Debian is one of the oldest ( first release on September 15, 1993 ) and most respected Linux
distributions. Many other distros are based on Debian's stable and well-tested foundation.
Examples include Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and elementary OS. These distros are known for their
user-friendliness, stability, and extensive software repositories.
</p>


    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">RedHat-Based Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) is a popular commercial Linux distribution. CentOS
and Fedora are two prominent distros that are based on RHEL. CentOS is known for
its use in server environments, while Fedora focuses on providing
bleeding-edge software and technologies.
</p>



    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Arch-Based Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
Arch Linux is known for its minimalistic approach and rolling release
model, where updates are continuous. Arch-based distros, such as Manjaro
and EndeavourOS, aim to provide the flexibility of Arch but
with easier installation and maintenance.
</p>



    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Slackware-Based Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
Slackware is one of the oldest Linux distributions, known for its simplicity
and adherence to UNIX principles. Slax and Zenwalk are distros based on
Slackware that cater to users who prefer a more traditional and minimalistic approach.
</p>



    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Gentoo-Based Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
Gentoo is a source-based distribution that allows users to compile software from
source code. Funtoo Linux and Sabayon Linux are distros that stem from Gentoo.
They offer a high degree of customization and performance optimization.
</p>



    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Lightweight Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
For older hardware or resource-constrained environments, lightweight
distros like Puppy Linux, antiX, and Tiny Core Linux are designed to
run efficiently and require minimal system resources.
</p>



    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Specific Purpose Distros</h1>
    </span>

<p>
There are also distros designed for specific purposes, such as security
and privacy (Tails, Kali Linux), multimedia production (Ubuntu Studio, Fedora Jam),
education (Edubuntu), and scientific research (Scientific Linux).
</p>

    <span style="color:#ff6600">
        <h1 style="font-size:20px">Choosing the right Distro</h1>
    </span>

<p>
Selecting a Linux distribution is about finding harmony between your needs
and the distro's offerings. Think of it like choosing the right tool for a
job – consider your goals, experience level, and the environment you're working
in. Whether you're a newcomer seeking user-friendliness, a tech enthusiast
craving customization, or a professional requiring stability, there's a
distro that aligns with your aspirations. It's a bit like trying on shoes
– find one that fits comfortably and complements your style. By focusing
on your intentions and preferences, you'll discover a Linux distro that suits
you like a well-tailored suit, enhancing your computing experience. You can
find a tree of ( not every, but a lot ) GNU / Linux Distros
<a class="text-link" href="distrofamilytree.png">here</a>, but you have to zoom in a lot in
order to be able to read anything.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Linux on Servers</h1>
</span>

<p>
Linux on servers is like the engine that powers websites, apps,
and online services. Instead of a room, think of it as a big warehouse
filled with computers working together. These servers manage data, host
websites, and make sure everything runs smoothly. They're like the hidden
heroes that keep the online world running smoothly. In simple words, Linux
on desktop is for your personal computer tasks, while Linux on servers is
the silent force that keeps the digital world running smoothly. Both are
important and work in different ways to make technology
useful and enjoyable for all of us.
</p>

<p>
In essence, Linux servers are the hidden powerhouses that
enable the digital world to function seamlessly. They ensure
your favorite websites load quickly, your emails reach their
destination, and online services run smoothly. While they may work
quietly in the background, their impact is vast, making them essential
players in the interconnected digital ecosystem.

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Desktop Environments ( DEs )</h1>
</span>

<p>
When you're choosing a desktop environment, it's like deciding
how your computer will look and work. Think of it like picking colors
and furniture for your room – you want it to feel right. There are different
styles, just like in fashion. Some people like the simple look of GNOME, some
prefer the fancy features of KDE, and others like the basic design of Xfce.
Each desktop environment has its own tools and options. It's a bit like
choosing the right tool for a job. If you're a developer, you might want a
clean and organized look. If you like creating art or videos, you'll want
an environment that helps you do that easily.
The most well-known DEs are Gnome, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, LXQT.

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Floating Window Managers ( WMs )</h1>
</span>

<p>
Floating window managers provide a flexible way to handle windows on your
screen. Unlike fixed layouts, they let windows "float" freely, like pieces
on a board. Imagine rearranging your room whenever you want – that's what
floating window managers offer. You can move and resize windows as you
please, like arranging furniture in your space. Whether you're a casual
user or a technical enthusiast, floating window managers bring a sense of
freedom to your digital world, adapting to your needs and preferences.
Most Linux beginners do not start with floating WMs, its aimed at more
advanced users. The most popular WMs are i3 and bspwm.

    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Booting your System</h1>
</span>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Bootloaders</h1>
</span>

<p>
Bootloaders are like the helpers that wake up your computer.
When you press the power button, they start everything. They make
sure your computer knows what to do and where to find everything. They're
leading your computer to wake up and start working. Without them, your
computer would stay asleep and not know what to do. They're the ones
who make sure everything starts smoothly. The most
popular option for Bootloaders is GRUB.
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Init-Systems</h1>
</span>

<p>
Init systems are in charge of setting up all the programs and services your
computer needs. They guide your computer's programs to start in the correct
order. From the moment you press the power button, they work behind the scenes
to get your computer up and running smoothly.
They are many different options when it comes to choosing
an init-system. The most used and well-known is Systemd, but there quite
a few other options like OpenRC and RunIt, just to name a few.
