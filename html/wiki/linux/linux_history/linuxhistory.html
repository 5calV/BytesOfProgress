    <h1 style="font-size:30px">History of Linux</h1>
</span>


<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
    Let's dive into the intriguing and inspiring history of GNU/Linux, 
    an operating system that has left an indelible mark on the world of 
    technology. This journey takes us back to the early 1980s, a time of 
    change and innovation, when a visionary named Richard Stallman set 
    out to transform the landscape of software and computing.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
Stallman was deeply concerned about the growing restrictions imposed by 
proprietary software. In response, he established the Free Software Foundation 
(FSF) in 1983, with the audacious goal of creating a complete computer system built 
entirely on free and open-source software. This system, known as GNU, aimed 
to give users the freedom to use, modify, and share software according to their needs.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
Linux Torvalds created the Linux kernel primarily as a personal project to 
fulfill his interest in operating systems and to address his own needs. 
This happened in 1991 when Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student, 
began working on his own operating system kernel as a hobby. 
He was inspired by the Unix operating system.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
At the time, Torvalds was using a computer that ran the MINIX operating 
system, which he found limiting and wanted to expand upon. He started 
developing his own kernel and released the first version, known as 
Linux 0.01, in September 1991. He released the Linux kernel under a 
special license called the GNU General Public License (GPL), which 
allowed anyone to use, learn from, and contribute to the development 
of the kernel. The project gained attention and attracted a community 
of developers who contributed code, bug fixes, and improvements. 
This collaborative effort led to the growth of the Linux kernel 
and the broader ecosystem of software around it.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
While Linux Torvalds initially created Linux as a personal project, 
it's important to note that the success and widespread adoption of 
Linux were shaped by its open-source nature and the contributions 
of many individuals and organizations over the years. The real magic 
happened when the GNU software and the Linux kernel joined forces. 
This mix made the operating system called GNU/Linux. This teamwork 
showed how people from everywhere can 
work together to create something awesome.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
But what's the big deal about "open source"? It's all about sharing. 
People like Stallman believed software should be free and open, 
so anyone can make it better. This idea became the "open source philosophy". 
In the early days, GNU/Linux was really good for powerful computers 
that did important jobs, like hosting websites. It was dependable 
and didn't cost too much, which businesses liked.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
The real magic occurred when the GNU software and the Linux kernel 
came together. This union gave birth to the GNU/Linux operating system, 
a milestone that showcased the power of collaboration and open-source 
innovation. The collective efforts of programmers worldwide led to the 
creation of a versatile and robust system that could be tailored to diverse needs.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
In the early days, GNU/Linux found its niche in serving as a reliable and 
cost-effective option for powerful computers handling crucial tasks, such 
as hosting websites. Its stability and scalability made it a favorite among 
businesses seeking dependable solutions.As for the first processor that 
the Linux kernel ran on, it was the Intel 80386, also known as the "i386". 
This marked the beginning of the Linux kernel's journey on x86 processors, 
which eventually became one of the most widely used 
architectures for running the kernel.
</p>

<p style="color:#ffff; font-size: 20px">
To sum it all up, the captivating tale of GNU/Linux showcases how working 
together, being innovative, and striving for software freedom can have a 
huge impact. It's a shining example of how a small group of people can 
shape the digital world we live in. This journey reminds us that when 
people collaborate and put in their collective effort, they can achieve 
truly incredible things. It's a lesson that tells us when we work together, 
we can achieve extraordinary things that make the world better for everyone.
