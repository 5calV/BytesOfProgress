        </span>

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>
  The Tor network operates decentralized and aims to provide users with
  anonymity and privacy while browsing the internet. In addition to
  providing anonymity for regular internet browsing, the Tor
  network also supports hidden services, which are websites a
  nd services that are only accessible through the Tor network.
  These hidden services use .onion domain names and are hosted
  on servers within the Tor network, providing an extra layer
  of anonymity for both the service provider and the users
  accessing the service.
</p>

<p>
  Here's how it works:
</p>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">TOR relays / nodes</h1>
</span>

<p>
  When a user connects to the Tor network, their internet traffic is routed
  through a series of relays, also known as nodes. These relays
  are operated by volunteers around the world.
</p>

<p>
  Each relay in the Tor network only knows the IP address of the previous
  relay and the next relay in the chain. This creates layers of encryption,
  similar to layers of an onion, hence the name "onion routing." As data
  passes through each relay, a layer of encryption is removed, revealing
  the routing information for the next hop.
  This process continues until the data reaches its destination.
</p>

<p>
  The final relay in the chain, known as the exit node, decrypts the final
  layer of encryption and sends the data to its destination on the
  regular internet. This exit node is the only point in the chain
  that can see the user's unencrypted data, but it does not know
  the original source of the data due to the layered encryption.
</p>

<p>
  This is the traffic's route when a TOR user accesses
  a website with a .com, .org, etc. TLD:
</p>

<p>
  When a TOR user accesses a .onion site, there are 2 more middle nodes.
  The rendezvous-point is where the nodes of the client and of the server
  find together to communicate:
</p>

<br>

<p>
  Because each relay only knows about the relay before and after it in
  the chain, it is difficult for anyone, including the exit node, to
  trace the user's activity back to their original IP address. This
  provides users with a high level of anonymity and privacy.
</p>

<p>
  The Tor network routes traffic in a way that is unpredictable
  and constantly changing, making it difficult for adversaries
  to monitor or track users' activities.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">TOR bridges</h1>
</span>

<p>
  Bridges in the Tor network are used to help users bypass censorship or
  restrictions imposed by network authorities. They act as entry points
  to the Tor network, similar to entry nodes, but they are not publicly
  listed in the main Tor directory. When using bridges, the number of
  middle nodes involved in a connection remains the same. The bridge
  serves as the entry point to the Tor network, and the connection
  continues to route through one or more middle nodes before
  reaching the exit node.
</p>

<p>
  Bridge addresses are not publicly listed in the main Tor directory
  to prevent them from being easily blocked by censors. Instead,
  bridge addresses are distributed through various channels, such
  as email lists, websites, or directly from trusted individuals.
</p>

<p>
  Bridges often use techniques to obfuscate their traffic to make it
  harder for censors to identify and block them. This can include
  using protocols like obfs4 (obfuscated TCP) or meek, which disguise
  Tor traffic as ordinary web traffic. When a user wants to connect
  to the Tor network using a bridge, they configure their Tor client
  to use the bridge's address. The Tor client then establishes a
  connection to the bridge, which acts as an entry point to the Tor network.
</p>

<p>
  Once the connection to the bridge is established, the Tor client negotiates
  a circuit through the Tor network as usual. This circuit typically consists
  of three nodes: the bridge itself, a middle node, and an exit node.
</p>

<p>
   By using bridges, users can access the Tor network without revealing their
   intention to connect to Tor, making it more difficult for censors to block
   or recognize their access. Additionally, the use of obfuscation techniques
   helps to further disguise Tor traffic, enhancing users' privacy and security.
</p>

<br>

<span style="color:#ff6600">
    <h1 style="font-size:25px">Snowflake</h1>
</span>

<p>
  Snowflake is a system that allows people from anywhere in the world to access
  censored websites and applications. Similar to VPNs that help users bypass
  internet censorship, Snowflake helps you avoid being noticed by internet
  censors by disguising your internet activity to appear as if you are
  using the internet for a regular video or voice call.
</p>

<p>
  There are numerous tools such as: B. Snowflake, which "transform" Internet
  activity, each using a different technique. Some redirect internet traffic
  to appear to come from popular cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure and
  Amazon Web Services. Others encrypt Internet traffic to make it appear
  completely random.
</p>

<p>
  Therefore, it becomes burdensome for censors to attempt to block such
  circumvention tools, as it would require blocking large portions of
  the Internet to achieve the original goal.
</p>

<p>
  Essentially, both Snowflake and a Tor bridge allow the user to access
  the Tor network to bypass censorship and surveillance. Both serve the
  purpose of promoting internet freedom. The main difference is how they
  work and how they are deployed. While a Tor bridge is a specialized
  infrastructure that anonymizes traffic, Snowflake uses volunteers
  to serve as a proxy for other people's traffic. In the end,
  however, both offer the user a similar benefit: anonymous
  access to the free Internet.
</p>

<p>
  You can join thousands of volunteers from around the world who have
  installed and are running a Snowflake proxy. You don't have to worry
  about what websites people are accessing through your Snowflake proxy.
  Their visible IP address will be the same as their Tor exit node, not yours.
</p>

<p>
  There are different ways to run a Snowflake proxy, with the easiest one
  being the Firefox, Chrome or Edge browser extensions.
</p>

<p>
  I implemented Snowflake right here on this site too, just
  enable it down below and keep this browser tab open!
